Designing a Language

1. Requirements:

* Paradigm (functional vs OOP)
* Variables
* Classes
* Data types
* Operators
    * Arithmetic operators
    * Logical operations
* Set theoretical notions
    * Sets
    * Lists
    * Arrays
    * Set operations
* Internal functions
* Marking beginning and end to the script
* Control flow: if/then, else, for while, etc.
* Loops
Python is dinamically typed. Type is understood 
thru context

NumPy: Array oriented programming
written in C, better memory allocation, storage is better
since it's single typed. Elements stored in Contiguous Memory locations

SciPy: Not Array oriented programming
